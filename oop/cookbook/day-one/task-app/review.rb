# What kind of questions to think about for each:

# ROUTER
# What actiion does the user want to accomplish?

# MODEL
# Does our model have this data?

# CONTROLLER
# What data do I need from the model?
# How should I display this / what view?

# VIEW
# What should I display to my user?



# We will add parsing into our cookbook!
# Where should this code go?
